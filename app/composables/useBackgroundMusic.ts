/**
 * A single, page-independent background-music player shared across an
 * entire wedding site visit (Opening -> Details -> RSVP).
 *
 * The actual <audio>/YouTube player lives here, at module scope, completely
 * outside any single component's lifecycle, so it keeps running as the
 * guest moves between pages instead of being destroyed and recreated on
 * every navigation. MusicToggle.vue (mounted fresh on every page) is just a
 * thin remote control.
 *
 * Setup ("prepare") is deliberately separate from actually starting
 * playback ("start"). preparePlayer() creates the underlying <audio>/YouTube
 * player and tells the browser to start buffering it as early as possible -
 * as soon as the wedding data loads, while the guest is still looking at
 * the closed envelope - without making any sound. The one-tap-late "lag"
 * guests were hearing was the player being created AND started at the same
 * instant the envelope was tapped, so the very first thing that happened
 * was kicking off a fresh network fetch. Priming it ahead of time means
 * that by the time the guest actually taps, there's little to nothing left
 * to wait for.
 *
 * This state is intentionally module-level (not inside the exported
 * function) so every component that calls useBackgroundMusic() shares the
 * exact same player and `playing` state for the lifetime of the browser
 * tab - a full page reload naturally resets it, which is correct (the
 * guest would see the envelope intro again from scratch anyway).

/**
 * Re-attempts playback whenever this tab/page becomes visible or active
 * again, as long as the guest hasn't paused the music themselves.
 *
 * Why this is needed: a guest who opens the link, taps the envelope (music
 * starts, `opened` becomes true), then backgrounds the browser - switching
 * apps, locking their phone, or dismissing an in-app browser sheet from
 * WhatsApp/Instagram - and later comes back to that same tab does NOT get a
 * fresh page load. Mobile browsers routinely auto-pause `<audio>`/embedded
 * video when a tab goes to the background, and do not resume it on their
 * own; some also restore the page from a frozen bfcache snapshot instead of
 * re-running the page's scripts. Either way, `opened` is already `true` on
 * return, so there's no fresh tap for ensurePlaying()'s gesture-gated start
 * to hook into - the track just stays silently paused forever after that
 * first backgrounding. This is exactly the "works the first time, not on
 * reopen" behavior reported. These listeners are the only remaining chance
 * to get the music going again on a guest's return, so every path that
 * marks something as playing calls bindResumeListeners() once.
